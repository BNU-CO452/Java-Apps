## Getting Started in Visual Studio Code

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## IntelliJ IDEA
If you want to use IJ instead of VSC, please create an empty IJ Java project, and copy all the java files and folders from the src folder in VSC and into the src folder in your new IJ project.  You will then have to create a new Git repository for your code and store that in GitHub.
